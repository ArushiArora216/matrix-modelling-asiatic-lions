# matrix-modelling-asiatic-lions
MATLAB code used to model the Asiatic lion population in India's Gir forest

This MATLAB code is used to calculate the intrinsic growth rate of the Asiatic lion population in India using Leslie matrices. It also contains relevant code to calculate the stable stage distribution and reproductive value of the population, obtain sensitivities to matrix elements and lower-level parameters, conduct an error analysis of the intrinsic growth rate, and finally, graphically depict how the intrinsic growth rate changes with changing values of annual survivorship for each life stage.
